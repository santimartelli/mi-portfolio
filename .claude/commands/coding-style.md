# General Coding Style

Maintain a consistent coding style across all files, ensuring modularity and following DRY principles.

## File Structure
- Code must start with path/filename as a one-line comment
- Organize imports logically (external libraries first, then internal modules)
- Keep file structure clean and organized

## Comments and Documentation
- Comments should describe purpose, not effect
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex business logic
- Avoid obvious comments that restate what the code does
- Document APIs and complex functions properly

## Code Organization
- Prioritize modularity in code structure
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Extract reusable logic into separate functions or modules
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

## Performance Considerations
- Prioritize performance in code design
- Avoid unnecessary computations and re-renders
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Consider memory usage and optimization

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Keep functions and classes small and focused
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Follow established patterns within the codebase

## Best Practices
- Extract constants and configuration values
- Use proper error handling
- Implement proper logging where appropriate
- Follow established architectural patterns
