# Code Quality Guidelines

Follow these code quality guidelines to maintain high standards across all TypeScript, React, CSS, and Astro files.

## Information Verification
- Always verify information before presenting it
- Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence
- Base decisions on concrete facts and established patterns

## Development Process
- Make changes file by file and allow for review between changes
- Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions
- Focus on the specific changes requested without additional modifications

## Communication Standards
- Avoid unnecessary apologies in code or communication
- Don't provide feedback about understanding in comments or documentation
- Don't summarize changes made unless specifically requested
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in context

## Code Preservation
- Preserve existing code and functionalities when making changes
- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities
- Pay attention to maintaining existing code structures
- Don't suggest updates when no actual modifications are needed

## Implementation Focus
- Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested
- Don't ask users to verify implementations visible in provided context
- Don't show or discuss current implementation unless specifically requested
- Provide links to actual files, not placeholder references

## Code Formatting
- Don't suggest whitespace changes unless they affect functionality
- Maintain existing formatting conventions within the codebase
- Follow established indentation and spacing patterns

## Quality Assurance
- Focus on delivering exactly what is requested
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Ensure changes integrate seamlessly with current implementation
